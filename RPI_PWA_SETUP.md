# Raspberry Pi PWA Setup Guide

Since you already have HTTPS set up with Tailscale on your Raspberry Pi, here's what you need to do after git pull to get your PWA working flawlessly on Android and iOS.

## 🚀 Quick Setup (After Git Pull)

### 1. Generate PWA Icons (Simplest Approach)
```bash
# Copy existing logo to create PWA icons (no dependencies required)
python3 copy_existing_icons.py

# OR if you want SVG icons (requires json module):
# python3 create_simple_pwa_icons.py
```

This will create all the required PWA icons in `fastag/static/icons/` directory.

### 3. Test Your PWA
Since you already have HTTPS with Tailscale, your PWA should work immediately!

```bash
# Start your existing Flask app
python3 wsgi.py
# or
./deploy.sh  # if you have a deployment script
```

## 📱 Testing PWA Features

### On Android:
1. Open Chrome on your Android device
2. Navigate to your Tailscale HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://your-rpi-tailscale-ip`)
3. You should see an "Install" button in the address bar
4. Tap it to install the PWA

### On iOS:
1. Open Safari on your iOS device
2. Navigate to your Tailscale HTTPS URL
3. Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
4. Select "Add to Home Screen"

## 🔍 Verify PWA is Working

### Check in Chrome DevTools:
1. Open your site in Chrome
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to Application tab
4. Check:
   - ✅ Manifest is loaded
   - ✅ Service Worker is registered
   - ✅ HTTPS is enabled

### Test Offline Functionality:
1. Install the PWA on your device
2. Turn off WiFi/mobile data
3. Open the PWA
4. Verify cached content loads

## 🛠️ Customization (Optional)

### Update App Information
Edit `fastag/static/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Your Custom FASTag App",
  "short_name": "FASTag",
  "description": "Your custom description",
  "theme_color": "#your-brand-color"
}
```

### Update Icons
1. Replace `fastag/static/logo.png` with your logo
2. Run: `python3 copy_existing_icons.py`
3. Icons will be regenerated

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If PWA doesn't install:
1. **Check HTTPS**: Ensure your Tailscale URL uses `https://`
2. **Check manifest**: Verify `https://your-url/static/manifest.json` loads
3. **Check service worker**: Verify `https://your-url/static/sw.js` loads
4. **Check icons**: Verify icon URLs are accessible

### If offline doesn't work:
1. **Check service worker registration** in browser DevTools
2. **Check cache storage** in DevTools → Application → Storage
3. **Verify HTTPS** is properly configured

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check if icons were generated
ls -la fastag/static/icons/

# Check if manifest is accessible
curl https://your-tailscale-url/static/manifest.json

# Check if service worker is accessible
curl https://your-tailscale-url/static/sw.js
```

### If you get JSON import errors:
```bash
# Use the simpler approach that doesn't require JSON:
python3 copy_existing_icons.py

# This will copy your existing logo.png to create all PWA icons
```

## 📊 Monitor PWA Performance

### Using Lighthouse:
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Lighthouse tab
3. Run PWA audit
4. Aim for 90+ score

### Check Service Worker:
- DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- Verify status is "activated and running"

## 🎯 What You Should See

After setup, your PWA should:
- ✅ **Install** on Android and iOS
- ✅ **Work offline** with cached content
- ✅ **Load fast** due to service worker caching
- ✅ **Look native** with standalone display mode
- ✅ **Show install prompt** in browsers

## 🚀 Production Tips

### For Better Performance:
1. **Enable gzip compression** in your web server
2. **Set proper cache headers** for static files
3. **Optimize images** for mobile devices

### For Better UX:
1. **Test on multiple devices** (Android, iOS, different screen sizes)
2. **Test offline scenarios** thoroughly
3. **Monitor user feedback** about the PWA experience

## 🔒 Security Notes

Since you're using Tailscale:
- ✅ **HTTPS is already secure** with Tailscale
- ✅ **No additional SSL setup** needed
- ✅ **PWA service workers** will work perfectly

## 📞 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Generate PWA assets (no dependencies required)
python3 copy_existing_icons.py

# Start development server
python3 wsgi.py

# Check PWA manifest
curl https://your-tailscale-url/static/manifest.json

# Test service worker
curl https://your-tailscale-url/static/sw.js

# Check if HTTPS is working
curl -I https://your-tailscale-url
```
